# Ink Mail

An email client for e-ink displays.

## Build yourself

This app is designed to have hardcoded email server login details. This means you must compile the program yourself with this information.

## Develop using Nix

Run `nix develop` to run the ad hoc devshell. Run `meson setup build` and then use `meson compile -C build` to build.
